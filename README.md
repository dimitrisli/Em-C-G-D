## What
Songs, Movie themes, Trailers, Soundtracks, Instrumental/Acoustic/Unplugged Songs, Covers, Videos, Ad clips, Stand-up Comedy or anything else that can be played in this chord progression.

## Why
Because it clicks every time we hear it and then we want to play/sing it ourselves.

## Key
If you play along, given the key, you'll might have to move it up/down like say Bm-G-D-A or just use a guitar capo to preserve the pattern.

## Why Em-C-G-D
These are non-barre guitar chords and probably the first chords you learn in piano.

## Which Part
If not the whole thing then its chorus/refrain.
